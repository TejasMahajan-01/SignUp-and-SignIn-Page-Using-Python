<h1 style = 'color:#0C73D1;' > Sign Up and Sign In Page Using Python </h1>

With the help of conditional formatting, I created a program in Python that functions as a sign-up and sign-in page. I demonstrated the programme utilising both local and permanent variables and databases. Even though this isn't a genuine website, it functions in a manner akin to how real websites do. If you do not meet all the requirements, such as having a valid username, email address, and password that combines letters, digits, and punctuation, you cannot proceed. It also checks if the user name and email have already been registered.
